This project provides a secure, automated setup for AWS OIDC authentication with GitHub Actions.

- Modular Bash script ([run.sh](run.sh)) for provisioning AWS IAM roles and trust policies
- Jinja2-based CloudFormation template rendering for IAM role and policies
- Modular policy management via the `policies/` directory
- GitHub Actions workflows for OIDC verification and code linting
- Documentation and CI/CD best practices

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PaulDuvall/gha-aws-oidc-bootstrap.git
cd gha-aws-oidc-bootstrap
```

### 2. Run the OIDC Setup & Deployment Script

You can now use the streamlined, fully automated workflow:

```bash
# Option 1: With a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to automatically set repo variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_XXXXXXXXXXXX
bash run.sh --github-org <your_org> --region us-east-1 --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Option 2: Without a GitHub token (manual mode)
bash run.sh --github-org <your_org> --region us-east-1
```

After running the script, you will see clear instructions for using the IAM Role in your GitHub Actions workflow. You can either reference the IAM Role ARN via a repository variable (recommended for teams) or directly in your workflow YAML (suitable for solo use).

Example:

```bash
bash run.sh --github-org PaulDuvall --region us-east-1
```

- The script uses the file `allowed_repos.txt` to determine which repositories will be granted access. List each repository (in the format `owner/repo`) on a separate line in that file before running the script.
- There is no `--repos` argument; repository access is controlled via the trust policy and the contents of `allowed_repos.txt`.

**GitHub Token Requirements:**
- [How to create your GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens):
  - Classic: `repo`, `workflow`, `admin:repo_hook`
  - Fine-grained: "Actions" (Read/Write), "Variables" (Read/Write), "Secrets" (if needed)

## Summary of Recent Changes (2025-04-23)

- **Switched to Jinja2-based CloudFormation template rendering** for the IAM role and policies, ensuring robust YAML block indentation and eliminating placeholder injection logic.
- **Removed obsolete scripts and templates**: `inject_trust_policy.py` and `iam_role.base.yaml`.
- **Policies are now modular and loaded from the `/policies` directory**; the renderer attaches all found policies to the IAM role.
- **Trust policy is dynamically generated** and injected into the CloudFormation template for least-privilege, multi-repo OIDC integration.
- **Deployment workflow and scripts updated** for clarity, maintainability, and security.

## Secure OIDC Integration: What Happens Under the Hood

This automation sets up secure OIDC authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS, eliminating static AWS credentials and enabling short-lived, tightly-scoped credentials for every workflow run. Hereâ€™s what happens automatically (and what youâ€™d otherwise do manually):

1. **Create the OIDC Identity Provider in AWS IAM**
   - Adds `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` as a provider and sets audience to `sts.amazonaws.com`.
2. **Create the IAM Role with Trust and Permissions**
   - Generates a trust policy allowing GitHub Actions from your current repo (and any in `allowed_repos.txt`) to assume the role via OIDC.
   - Attaches a permissions policy granting only the required AWS actions.
3. **Set the GitHub Repository Variable**
   - Sets the `GHA_OIDC_ROLE_ARN` variable in your GitHub repository, referencing the IAM Role ARN.
4. **(Optional) Manage Parameter Store/Secrets**
   - If needed, configures AWS SSM Parameter Store entries using SecureString and grants the IAM Role permission to read them.
5. **Update Trust Policy for Cross-Repo Access**
   - To allow another repo, add it to `allowed_repos.txt` and rerun the script.

## Automated Multi-Repo OIDC Trust Policy

This project automatically generates a flexible IAM trust policy for GitHub Actions OIDC integration based on the repositories listed in `allowed_repos.txt`.

- **Do NOT commit your `allowed_repos.txt` file.** It is gitignored by default. Instead, use the provided `allowed_repos.txt.example` as a template for contributors.

---

## Customizing AWS Permissions with the `policies/` Directory

- Place one or more IAM policy JSON files (e.g., `lambda.json`, `s3-readonly.json`) in the `policies/` directory.
- When you run `run.sh`, the script automatically attaches all policy files in `policies/` to the IAM OIDC role.
- Each policy file should define only AWS permissions (not GitHub repo logic). Repository access is controlled by the trust policy, not these files.

---

## Best Practices
- Never scope policies to a single GitHub repository.
- Keep policies minimal and auditable.
- Remove or archive policy files you do not need (principle of least privilege).
- Review `policies/README.md` for more details and examples.
